## Fiasco dice app

Install vagrant and virtual box on your system  
run `vagrant up` in the same folder as the Vagrantfile


NOTE: Vagrant does not play nice with npm and windows.  When running npm install, you must do so on the host machine (your machine)  
Then, you should be able to run everything else from the vagrant box
